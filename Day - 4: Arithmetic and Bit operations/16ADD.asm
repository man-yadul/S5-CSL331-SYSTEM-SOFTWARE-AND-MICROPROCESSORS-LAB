; Yadul Manoj 69
; 8086 program to add two 16-bit numbers (with carry)
; The numbers to be added are stored in AX and BX registers
; CX is used to store carry before result is stored in memory
; The final result is stored in a word reserved in the memory (RESULT)
; If a carry is generated, it is stored in the next word succeeding to RESULT
; CF being set signifies a carry

DATA SEGMENT
    NUM1 DW 0EC54H	    ; First operand
    NUM2 DW 5678H           ; Second operand
    RESULT DW 01 DUP(?)	    ; Word of memory reserved for result

CODE SEGMENT
START:
    MOV AX, DATA            ; Initialize data segment
    MOV DS, AX

    MOV AX, NUM1            ; Move NUM1 to AX register
    MOV BX, NUM2            ; Move NUM2 to BX register

    CLC                     ; Clear carry flag
    XOR CX, CX              ; Clear CX register

    ADD AX, BX              ; Add the operands, result is stored in AX
    JNC NEXT                ; Jump to NEXT if no carry is generated
    INC CX                  ; Carry is generated and CX is incremented to signify a carry to store it in result
NEXT:
    MOV DI, OFFSET RESULT   ; Move offset of RESULT to DI
    MOV [DI], AX            ; Store result at memory address in DI
    INC DI                  ; DI before this instruction points to the offset of RESULT. A word beginning from this location is already occupied for 16-bit result
    INC DI                  ; In order to store the carry at the next word, INC is done twice since it only increments by a byte 
    MOV [DI], CX            ; Store carry
	
    MOV AH, 4CH             ; Return to DOS prompt
    INT 21H
